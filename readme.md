# Now Thoughts

This was a fun project I did to play with some new technologies and to
create a fun product.  Now thoughts is built with Ionic, Stencil, and Firebase.

Now Thoughts allows you to input something like a celebrity, a sports team,
or a company, and see what the sentiment is for it on social media.  It has
two modes, single and multi.  Single will allow you to search for a single term
and see the sentiment and a couple of posts about that term.  Multi will allow
you to search for related topics and be able to compare their sentiments together.
